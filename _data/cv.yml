  # PhD Researcher | Prof. Raul Castro Fernandez, University of Chicago | Chicago, IL
# 09/2023 - Present
# Research problems in Data Sharing: how to help data-driven organizations combine their data with others to unleash their value. Develop a model to describe data sharing called the Dataflow.
# Utilize the Dataflow model to find commonalities between various Privacy Enhancing Technologies, and evaluate them over the dimensions of trust, scope, and performance.
